Exercise: Trap Bar Straight Leg Deadlift
Utility: Basic
Mechanics: Compound
Force: Pull
Preparation: Stand on platform under loaded trap bar. Squat down and grasp handles to sides. Squat / Deadlift bar up to standing position.
Execution: With knees straight, lower bar down by bending hips. After hips can no longer flex, bend waist as weights approach floor. Hands should be lowered near sides of ankles. Set weight on floor. Lift bar by extending waist and hip until standing upright. Pull shoulders back slightly if rounded. Repeat.
Comments: Not all trap bar designs may allow for this movement. A squared open-ended trap bar is used in this demonstration. Begin with very light weight and add additional weight gradually to allow lower back adequate adaptation. Throughout lift, keep arms and knees straight. Do not pause or bounce at bottom of lift. Do not lower weight beyond mild stretch throughout hamstrings and low back. When finished with set, dismount by lowering weight with knees bent and low back straight. Full range of motion will vary from person to person. Those with less flexibility may need lower platform or may not even need to stand on elevated surface. See Dangerous Exercise Essay.
